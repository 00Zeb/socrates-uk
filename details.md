### Costs

This is a nonprofit gathering and the only fees will be hotel accommodation (including meals & non alcoholic beverages) and transportation to the venue. All attendees, including the organisers, will be paying these fees.

Eventbrite will be used for registration, with a £100 up front non-refundable deposit required to secure a ticket.

The final balance will be settled at the hotel checkout. The deposit counts against this.

We are also looking to secure **sponsorship** which will go directly to bring the ticket costs down. If you would be interested to sponsor [please get in touch.][info@socratesuk.org]

If you're in London or coming from abroad we recommend you get the train from **Paddington** headed to Hereford or Great Malvern and get off at **Moreton-in-Marsh**, it takes between one and a half hours and two depending on the service you take.

Please let us know if you're coming through this route and at what time, we will arrange for taxi's to pick you up in groups from the station. Each taxi should be a max of £25 each way.

The fastest way to get to London from any airport is by train, take a look at [National Rail website][National Rail] for routes, times, prices and to book your tickets to have them ready for collection at the station. If you are coming in a group bear in mind you could be saving money. Three or four people travelling together pay only two tickets if the service is during off-peak time (you need to get this group tickets at the ticket office rather than on the machines at the train station).

If you prefer to get to London by bus, National Express is probably the best option, with WIFI on their buses, click on [National Express from airports][] for routes and prices.

Once in London you might need a tube map, take a look [to the TFL tube map][Tube Map]. Fares for tube and bus in London are [here][Transport for London Fares]. For more info on transport in London visit [TFL's website][Transport for London]
