                <h3>International Software Craftsmanship <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_technology" target="_blank">open space</a> retreat</h3>
                <h4>September 19th - 22nd, <a href="http://cotswoldconferencecentre.com/location/how-to-get-here/farncombe-estate/" target="_blank">Farncombe estate</a></h4>

        <h3>Pre-conference organization</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference/">UnConference.net</a> is a good place to find out what to expect and what to prepare before hand.</p>
        <p>We will setup a wiki for attendees to submit session ideas and anything else prior to the event. This will also include ideas for evening activities</p>

        <h3>Accomodation</h3>
        <p>Check-in will be on Thursday 19th September, we expect most attendees to arrive during the evening, all by dinner time.</p>
        <p>There are X twin rooms and Y singles. (???En suite???) with a total capacity of 70 attendees.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to share a room with someone you already know there will be a page on the wiki where you can register your preference.</p>

        <h3>Location and how to get there</h3>
        <p>The best place to find out how to get there is <a href="http://cotswoldconferencecentre.com/location/how-to-get-here/farncombe-estate/">Farncombe's site</a></p>
        <p>If you're in London or coming from abroad, we recommend you get the train from Paddington to Hereford or Great Malvern, and get off at Honeybourne.</p>
        <p>Please let us know if you're coming through this route and at what time, we will arrange for taxi's to pick you up in groups from the station.</p>

        <h3>Costs</h3>
        <p>This is a not for profit attendee run event and the only fee will be accommodation, which includes meals but not alcoholic beverages (??? What about normal beverages???) and transportation costs to the venue.</p>
        <p>Eventbrite will be used for registration, with a £100 up front non-refundable deposit required to secure a ticket.</p>
        <p>The final balance will be settled at the hotel checkout. The deposit counts against this. Overall, we expect tickets to be around £360 per person for 3 nights.</p>
        <p>We are also looking to secure <b>sponsorship</b> which will go directly to bring the ticket costs down. If you would be interested to sponsor <a href="">please get in touch.</a></p>
