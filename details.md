### Costs

This is a non-profit gathering and the only fees will be hotel accommodation (including meals & non-alcoholic beverages) and transportation to the venue. All attendees, including the organisers, will be paying these fees.

Eventbrite will be used for registration, with a £100 up-front **non-refundable deposit** required to secure a ticket.

The final balance, which includes the deposit, will be settled upon checking out of the hotel.

We are also looking to secure **sponsorship** which will go directly towards bringing the ticket costs down. If you are interested in sponsoring SoCraTes UK, take a look at the [Sponsorship page][Sponsorship] and [please get in touch][info@socratesuk.org].

The best place to find out how to get there is [Farncombe's site][Farncombe Estate].

If you're in London or coming from abroad we recommend you get the train from **Paddington** headed to Hereford or Great Malvern and get off at **Moreton-in-Marsh**. It takes between one and a half and two hours depending on the service you take.

Please let us know if you're coming through this route and at what time. We will arrange for taxis to pick up attendees in groups from the station. Each taxi should be no more than £25 each way.

The fastest way to get to London from any airport is by train. Take a look at [National Rail][] for routes, times, prices and to book your tickets. If you are coming in a group, bear in mind you could save money. Three or four people travelling together pay for only two tickets if the service is off-peak (remember, you need to get these group tickets at the ticket office, rather than online or using the ticket machines at the train station).

If you prefer to get to London by coach, [National Express][National Express from airports] is probably the best option, with wi-fi on their coaches.
